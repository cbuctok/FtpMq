# FtpMq
Run stupid commands in the old fashioned way

## Idea
So you have some small ftp server and you don't really have (or need) some fancy mq to connect your
multiple unreliable machines and you are lazy with this fancy VPN/WireGuard thing.

Just ftp that shit like it's (banking system) 90s!

Run that C# thing with arguments (that are still not defined),
and then run the questionable script on your old machine (after downloading file ofc).
